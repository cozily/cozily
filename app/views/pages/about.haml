    # About Us

    ## _What are we doing?_

    Cozily is a free site for both renters and landlords. It is for no fee apartments only, which means no
    brokers will try to woo you. You can search for apartments from a map view, so that you can see everything
    we've got that meets your criteria without paging through lots of listings. We'll also send you email
    updates with new apartments that meet your criteria.

    Quit checking Craigslist every five minutes. Tell us what you're looking for. We'll find it for you.

    ## _Where are we headed?_

    Aside from getting more listings directly from landlords, so that you’ve got the cleanest and most
    reliable source for listings, we’re working on creating more tailored ways of searching, so that you can
    find apartments that are right for you. We’ll help you get to know the neighborhood and the area around a
    prospective apartment before moving in. Sign up for our email updates so that you know what’s new!

    We want to find the right place for you. We want to help introduce you to your community. We want you to
    have fun and feel taken care of.

          You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

          Genna made her voyage to New York City from Florida, but not before picking up a love of the ocean and
          a degree in Music Composition. Never one to pass up interesting graduate degrees, she completed a
          Master's degree at NYU, specializing in Music Composition for Film.

          After a brief stint in Los Angeles, where she started a music house with a handful of talented
          composers, she came back to New York and dug into another Master's degree. This time, at the University
          of Pennsylvania, she focused on Positive Psychology and Organizational Behavior.

          We've managed to tackle her in between relentless bouts of education, benefiting from he more recent
          experience in product management and consulting with agile development teams. She's currently got her
          telescope on Cozily's long-term vision, working to help us build an application that finally makes
          finding an apartment fun.

          Oh, and she also teaches yoga.
