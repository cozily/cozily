FixtureBuilder
==============

Based on the code from fixture_scenarios. Allows you to build file fixtures from an object mother factory.

Example
=======

When using an object mother such as factory_girl it can be setup like the following:

FixtureBuilder.configure do |config|
  config.factory do
    include Girl
    
  end
end

The block passed to the factory method initiates the creation of the fixture files.

There are also additional configuration options that can be changed to override the defaults:
files_to_check: array of filenames that when changed cause fixtures to be rebuilt
fixture_builder_file: the pathname of the file used to store file changes.
record_name_fields: array of field names to use as a fixture's name prefix, it will use the first matching field it finds
skip_tables: array of table names to skip building fixtures
select_sql: sql string to use for select
delete_sql: sql string to use for deletes

By default these are set as:
files_to_check: %w{ db/schema.rb }
fixture_builder_file: RAILS_ROOT/tmp/fixture_builder.yml
record_name_fields: %w{ schema_migrations }
skip_tables: %w{ schema_migrations }
select_sql: SELECT * FROM `%s`
delete_sql: DELETE FROM `%s`
